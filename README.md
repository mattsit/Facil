facil is a Facebook Chatbot that facilitates in friend circles opportunities for time to be spent together. The process flow is that an initiating user will ask facil to gather input from a group of friends. Then, facil will aggregate these responses together in order to suggest and help guide groups towards reaching a decision. facil uses node js and is deployed via Heroku in order to achieve integration with Facebook Messenger. It also leverages IBM Watson for natural language processing.

This chatbot was submitted as a project to SF Hacks in 2016 and was awarded the Artificial Intelligence prize.
